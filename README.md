FunObjc
=======

Radically opinionated code to simplify and empower iOS & OSX development.

I use this for all my iOS development.

Add Classes/FunObjc to your project and `#import "FunObjc.h"`.

If you want Classes/FunMore as well you'll need to add the sqlite3 static library to your project settings.
